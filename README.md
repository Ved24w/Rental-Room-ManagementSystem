# 🏠 Student Rental Room System

## 🌟 Overview

This project is an innovative, comprehensive solution designed to **streamline the entire room rental process specifically for university students and property owners.** By replacing outdated, manual search methods, our system provides an efficient, user-friendly platform that increases transparency and convenience for all stakeholders.

The core goal is to **optimize the rental experience** for both users and property owners, minimizing vacancy times and reducing stress for students seeking housing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run a local copy of the project for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following installed on your local machine:

* **[Specify Requirement 1, e.g., Node.js (v16+)]**
* **[Specify Requirement 2, e.g., Python (v3.10+)]**
* **[Specify Requirement 3, e.g., Git]**

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Student-Rental-Room-System.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Student-Rental-Room-System.git)
    cd Student-Rental-Room-System
    ```
2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Adjust command based on your backend (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt or npm install)
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies (if using a separate client directory):**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```
4.  **Database Setup:**
    * Configure your database connection string in the `.env` file.
    * Apply database migrations:
        ```bash
        # Example command for Django/SQL: 
        # python manage.py migrate 
        # Example command for Mongoose: 
        # (Migrations typically handled implicitly by Mongoose)
        ```

### Running the System

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # Example command (adjust based on your project scripts)
    npm run server 
    ```
2.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    ```bash
    # Example command (adjust based on your project scripts)
    npm run client 
    ```
*(Tip: If you set up a single combined script like `npm run dev`, you can use that instead to start both simultaneously.)*

The application should now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:[PortNumber]`.
